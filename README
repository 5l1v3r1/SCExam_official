The software runs a simulation of positive pions in a sampling calorimeter.
The kind of particle, being assigned for the exam, is hard-coded; on the other
hand, the other parameters can be set through the command line.

Compile with:
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake /path-to-this-repo
- make

The executable produced is called "exampleSCE". It has to be run with the
following arguments (mandatory):

./exampleSCE [-ev number of events ] [-en pion energy (GeV)] [-nl number of layers] [-am absorber material] [-lt active layers thickness (cm)]

Example:
./exampleSCE -ev 10000 -en 10 -nl 20 -am G4_Pb -lt 5
will run a beam of 10 pions of energy 10 GeV each on in a calorimeter made of
20 layers, where the absorber layer is made of lead and measures 5 cm.
